   答：Stop play immediately and assess the player a Minor penalty for Ineligible Player.
   
   理由：规则要求头盔脱落必须立即离场或戴好，继续参与比赛属于“不合格球员”，处以小罚。

   答：High-sticking, cross-checking, slashing, spearing, butt-ending.

5. [Rule 10.4c] An attacking player kicks the puck with one or both of his skates and the puck goes directly into the opposing net... What is the referee's decision?
   
   答：The goal is disallowed.
   
   理由：进攻方踢球进球（无论是直接还是经他人折射）均被视为非法进球。

6. [Rule 4.13b, Note 2] Team "A" is serving a Minor penalty. The referee signals a delayed Minor penalty to Team "A". Team "B" scores before the stoppage of play. Which penalty is terminated?

   答：Yes.
   
   理由：防守队员将球踢进自家球门，得分有效。

9. [Rule 4.1e] When a player is assessed both a Minor and a Major penalty at the same time, which of these penalties is served first?
   
   答：Major.
   
   理由：规则规定，大罚（Major）必须在小罚（Minor）之前执行。

11. **[Rule 1.3(d)] The Ice Surface is divided into which three zones:**
    
    - **Answer**: Attacking, neutral, defending zones.
    
    - **Reason**: 这是冰球场地的基础物理划分，两条蓝线将冰面分为进攻区、中立区和防守区。

12. **[Rule 2.5(f) Note 1] If in course of making a substitution, either the player entering the game or the player leaving the game intentionally plays the puck... the Referee would assess:**
    
    - **Answer**: Too many players on the ice penalty.
    
    - **Reason**: 当替换过程中的两名球员同时参与比赛（即未在规定范围内且有意触球），属于“场上人数过多”违例。

13. **[Rule 4.4b] When cancelling penalties in Coincidental penalty situations, you must start by cancelling out...**
    
    - **Answer**: The Major Penalties.
    
    - **Reason**: 抵消罚则（Coincidental Penalties）的计算原则是优先匹配并取消时长相等的重罚，因此首先处理大罚（Major Penalties）。

14. **[Rule 9.3] A player being obstructed by an opposition player embellishes his actions as he falls to the ice. What action should the referee take?**
    
    - **Answer**: Assess the player a Minor penalty for Unsportsmanlike Conduct - Diving.

    - **Answer**: A Major penalty and a Game Misconduct penalty or a Match penalty.

16. **[Rule 4.13b, Note 2] Team "A" is serving a Minor penalty. The referee signals a delayed Minor penalty to Team "A". Team "B" scores before the stoppage of play. Which penalty is terminated when the goal is scored?**
    
    - **Answer**: The Minor penalty being served.
    
    - **Reason**: 当对方进球时，正在执行且使该队处于少打多状态的第一个小罚终止，而延迟判罚的小罚仍需记录。

17. **[Rule 4.13 Situation 9] The referee has signaled a delayed double minor penalty against #14 of Team "A" for spearing. Team "B" scores before the play is stopped. What does the referee do?**
    
    - **Answer**: The Goal is allowed. Two minutes of the Double Minor are washed out. The player serves two minutes.
    
    - **Reason**: 对于双重小罚（Double Minor），进球会抵消其中一个2分钟，球员仍需上场执行剩下的2分钟。

18. **[Rule 10.4b] Does the goal count if a defending player kicks the puck into his own goal?**
    
    - **Answer**: Yes.
    
    - **Reason**: 防守队员将球踢进自家球门视为有效进球。

19. **[Rule 4.1e] When a player is assessed both a Minor and a Major penalty at the same time, which of these penalties is served first?**

    - **Answer**: A Match penalty.

21. **A player elbows another player in the head. What penalty could be assessed? (HC Rule 7.6)** 答：**e) Both c & d are accurate.** 理由：根据 2020 年后的新规，涉及头部的肘击应直接判定为“头部接触（Head Contact）”。罚则包括小罚（Minor）、双重小罚（Double Minor）、5分钟大罚+比赛不当行为（Major + GM）或停赛罚（Match Penalty）。

22. **What penalty shall be assessed to any player or team official that attempts to kick or deliberately kicks an opponent? (Rule 7.1c-iii)** 答：**Match Penalty.** 理由：踢人动作在冰球中具有极高危险性，无论是否造成伤害，在 HC 规则下通常直接处以停赛罚（Match Penalty）。

23. **Two misconduct penalties in the same game result in...(Rule 4.7c)** 答：**A game misconduct.** 理由：同一场比赛中累积两次 10 分钟不当行为罚（Misconduct），将自动升级为比赛不当行为罚（Game Misconduct），球员必须离场。

24. **From the list below, select the 5 stick penalties that qualify for a game ejection penalty after one player has accrued three in the same game. (Rule 4.8b-i)** 答：**High Sticking, Slashing, Butt-ending, Spearing, Cross-checking.** 理由：HC 规则 4.8b 规定，单场比赛累计三次“球杆违例”的球员将被驱逐（Game Ejection）。这五项属于标准球杆违例清单。

25. **Team A has a delayed offside against them... While the delayed offside is in effect, B6 shoots the puck in his own net. Goal or no goal? (Rule 6.12b)** 答：No Goal. A goal cannot be scored during a delayed offside under any circumstance. 理由：这是 Hockey Canada 与 NHL 规则的重要区别。HC 规则明确：在延迟越位期间，进攻方不能得分，即使是防守方将球打入自家球门，进球也无效。

26. **What penalty is assessed to a player or goaltender who participates in the play with a broken stick? (Rule 3.2d, 10.6a)** 答：**Minor penalty.** 理由：严禁使用断杆参与比赛，违者处以 2 分钟小罚。

27. **A coach or player says to a referee "I am going to wait for you in the parking lot and run you down with my car". What penalty should be assessed? (Rule 10.5c, 1)** 答：**A Match Penalty.** 理由：对裁判的人身威胁属于严重的非法行为（Abuse of Officials），应处以停赛罚（Match Penalty）。

28. **A player from the opposing team shoots towards the open goal. As the puck is about to enter, a defending player knocks the goal of its mooring(s). Do you award a goal? (Interpretation 4 Rule 4.12a,b)** 答：**No, the goalie is still on the ice.** 理由：只有在守门员已被替换下场（空网）的情况下故意推离球门才判得分。若守门员在场但不在球门内，则判定点球。

29. In Hockey Winnipeg's rule book, 4 penalties of any kind result in a game ejection. What other combinations of penalties result in a game ejection penalty? (HC Rule 4.8b)
    
    - **Answer**: e) Both b and c (3 stick penalties; 3 head contact penalties in minor/female).
    
    - **Reason**: 根据 HC 规则 4.8b，除了累计 4 次任意罚则外，单场累计 3 次球杆违例或 3 次头部接触违例（特定组别）也会触发自动驱逐。

30. Black 7 Receives 2+2 at 4:03. Black 8 receives 2 minutes at 3:33. White scores a goal at 3:15. Who gets out of the box? (Rule 4.5d, Interpretation 5)
    
    - **Answer**: b) No one gets out of the box, Black 7's penalty is reduced to 2 minutes. 5 on 3 continues.
    
    - **Reason**: 小罚终止原则（Termination of Minor Penalty）。进球时，先受罚的 Black 7 还有两部分罚时。第一段（已执行 48s）在进球时被“冲销”，Black 7 仍需留在箱内执行剩下的第二个 2 分钟。

    - **Answer**: Half-Piston.

19. **The clock has been cut (rented ice time). Team A tries to call a time out. State Referee's decision. (Hockey Winnipeg SR19-2)** 答：**c) Do not allow the timeout as timeouts are not allowed if the clock has been cut.** 理由：根据温尼伯冰球协会（HW）特殊规定，一旦比赛因租用场地时间到期而采取“切钟（Cut Clock）”运行，则不允许使用暂停。
